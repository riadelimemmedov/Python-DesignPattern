# Python Design Patterns

Python Design Patterns is a collection of code examples that demonstrate various software design patterns using the Python programming language. The repository is maintained by Riad Alimammedov and is licensed under the MIT License.

## Design Patterns
This repository contains code examples for three categories of software design patterns:   

    * Creational Patterns -> These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

    * Structural Patterns -> These patterns deal with object composition, trying to assemble objects into larger structures while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

    * Behavioral Patterns -> These patterns deal with communication between objects, trying to define the ways objects interact and communicate with each other to form larger solutions.

Here is a list of design patterns implemented in this repository:
    
    







### Creational Patterns
    * Singleton
    * Factory Method
    * Abstract Factory
    * Builder
    * Prototype

#
### Structural Patterns
    * Adapter
    * Bridge
    * Composite
    * Decorator
    * Facade
    * Flyweight
    * Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns
    * Chain of Responsibility
    * Command
    * Interpreter
    * Iterator
    * Mediator
    * Memento
    * Observer
    * State
    * Strategy
    * Template Method
    * Visitor

Each pattern is implemented using the Python programming language and explained with sample code snippets and comments.


### Getting Started
To get started with this repository, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/


#### Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository using the following command:
    git clone https://github.com/riadelimemmedov/Python-DesignPattern.git

#### After cloning the repository, you can navigate to the directory of the pattern you want to run and execute the Python file. For example, to run the Singleton pattern example, you can navigate to the Singleton directory and run the following command:
    python Singleton.py
